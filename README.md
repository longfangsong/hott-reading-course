# Introduction to homotopy type theory (reading course)

Autumn term 2023, study period 2, 7.5 credits

* For master students, this is an instance of *Research-oriented course in Computer Science and Engineering* (Chalmers: [DAT235](https://www.student.chalmers.se/sp/course?course_id=36287), GU: [DIT577](https://kursplaner.gu.se/pdf/kurs/en/DIT577)).
* PhD students can take this course as a PhD course.

This course is run as a self-study reading course.
Therefore, you must have the capacity and motivation to read and digest material without teacher presence.

## Course purpose

Homotopy type theory is a young area at the intersection of computer science, mathematical logic, homotopy theory.
It is based on the discovery of rich higher structure in the identity type of Martin-LÃ¶f type theory.
This relates to homotopy theory, an area of mathematics.
Homotopy type theory can serve as a constructive logical foundation with powerful extensionality principles ("when are two objects to be equal?").
It is also an internal language for higher toposes, a kind of mathematical objects useful in certain areas of modern mathematics.

This reading course serves as an introduction to this area.
After completing this course, you will be able to:

* explain the basic concepts of homotopy type theory,
* reason in homotopy type theory on a basic level,
* spot faults in logical deductions,
* characterize the identity types of concretely given types,
* classify types according to their truncation level,
* manipulate higher inductive types,
* translate between the different perspectives of univalent mathematics on mathematical objects (for example, abstract versus concrete groups),

## Prerequisites

For master students:
* The prerequesites of DAT235/DIT577 apply.
* You must have passed DAT350/DIT235 *Types for programs and proofs*.

  Alternatively, you must have documented knowledge in category theory.
  If you have not seen type theories before, it may take you extra effort at the beginning of the course to become familiar with these kinds of logical systems.

For PhD students:
* Contact the course-responsible teacher with your background in type theory or category theory.

## Course design

We will read Egbert Rijke's *Introduction to Homotopy Type Theory* and selected chapters of *Homotopy Type Theory: Univalent Foundations of Mathematics* (see [Literature](#literature)).

For every week, the course-responsible teacher will select sections for you to read and exercises to solve.
You should do this on your own (you are welcome to form study groups).
In particular, you should solve all the selected exercises to the best of your ability.

Every week, we will have a two-hour meeting where:
* we will discuss the sections you have read,
* you will present solutions to some of the exercises.

You are expected to take an active role in the weekly meetings.
All students must present exercise solutions at least once (see [Examination](#examination)).
If you exceptionally cannot attend a meeting, you may send in your solutions electronically; we might make it possible for you to receive feedback.

Two hours are too short to discuss all of the material.
Therefore, we encourage you to organize independent meetings and discuss the material on your own.
Additionally:
* we have a Zulip instance (see [Communication](#communication)) for online questions and discussions,
* the teachers may offer consultation times.

## Examination

To pass this course, you need to:
* successfully present exercise solutions in our weekly meetings at least once,
* pass a final written exam.

Beyond the feedback you receive when you present your solution, your exercise solutions will not be graded.
However, you are welcome to grade each other informally, particularly for exercise solutions that were not presented due to lack of time.

If you have satisfied the exercise presentation requirement as above, you are eligible for the exam.
This will be a four-hour written hall exam with no aids allowed.
The exam problems will be similar to the exercises you have solved.
It may include problems of different levels for the purpose of grade differentiation.
More details will be announced in time before the exam.

### For PhD students

If you take this course as a PhD course, you need to do some additional work to pass.
* You must be active in our weekly discussions.
  This includes giving feedback to students who present exercise solutions.
  Additionally, you may be asked to give feedback for students who hand in electronic solutions.
* You need to achieve a grade of at least 4 in the exam.

## Course schedule

The weekly meetings will be scheduled according to the results of [this poll](https://choodle.portal.chalmers.se/YZVDfAyYLAyTXKVW), so please vote (answers are private).
It will take place on the Johanneberg campus.

The date for the final exam will be announced a month before the end of course.
It will be scheduled in consideration of the participants' schedules.

## Course literature

* Egbert Rijke's [*Introduction to Homotopy Type Theory*](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.11082).

  This is the main book the course is based on.
  A printed version is due to appear, but the above version will remain freely available.

* [*Homotopy Type Theory: Univalent Foundations of Mathematics*](https://homotopytypetheory.org/book/) by the Univalent Foundations Program.

  This is a secondary resource.
  We may use it for some further topics such as higher inductive types.

## Communication

We use [Zulip](https://lot.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/407220-HoTT-reading-course) for announcements and online discussions.

Our stream is called *HoTT reading course*.

The stream is organized into *topics* (Zulip lingo for threads).
Feel free to create new topics, for example for questions that you want to discuss.
This is useful if you are stuck on something in your weekly reading.
Conversely, you can help your fellow students by engaging with and possibly answering their questions.

One benefit of Zulip over Slack and Discord is that it is free software.
It also supports [LaTeX rendering](https://zulip.com/help/latex)!

## How to register

For master students: contact the examiner.
As stated in the course syllabus for DAT235/DIT577, it is up to the examiner to decide whether a student is accepted to the course or not.

For PhD students: obtain the approval of your supervisor and examiner.
Then contact the course-responsible teacher.
