# Introduction to homotopy type theory (reading course)

* Offered via DAT235: Research-oriented course in Computer Science and Engineering
* Autumn term 2023, study period 2, 7.5 credits

## Teaching team

* Course responsible teacher: Christian Sattler
* Examiner: Ana Bove

## Course purpose

Homotopy type theory is young area at the intersection of computer science, mathematical logic, homotopy theory.
It is based on the discovery of rich higher structure in the identity type of Martin-LÃ¶f type theory.
This relates to homotopy theory, an area of mathematics.
Homotopy type theory can serve as a constructive logical foundation with powerful extensionality principles ("when are two objects to be equal?").
It is also an internal language for higher toposes, a kind of mathematical objects useful in certain areas of modern mathematics.

This reading course serves as an introduction to this area.

## Learning objectives

After this course, you should be able to:

* explain the basic concepts of homotopy type theory,
* reason in homotopy type theory on a basic level,
* recognize if some given logical deduction makes sense or is faulty,
* characterize the identity types of concretely given types,
* classify types according to their truncation level,
* translate between the different perspectives of univalent mathematics on mathematical objects (for example, abstract versus concrete groups).

## Prerequisites

* You should be familiar with type theory, for example via a previous course.
  Alternatively, you should have a background in category theory.

  If you have not seen type theories before, it may take you extra effort at the beginning of the course to become familiar with these kinds of logical systems.

* You should have the capacity for self-study.
  This includes the motivation and ability to read and digest material without teacher presence.

## Course design

We will read Egbert Rijke's *Introduction to Homotopy Type Theory* (link below).

For every week, I will select sections in the book for you to read and exercises to solve.
You should do this on your own (you are welcome to independently form study groups).

Every week, we will have a two-hour meeting to discuss the sections you have read.
There, we will answer any questions you bring up.
Additionally, you will present solutions to some of the exercises.

## Examination

To pass this course, you need to:
* present solutions to exercises in our weekly meetings,
* pass a final written exam.

Beyond the feedback you receive if you present your solution, your exercise solutions will not be graded.
However, you are welcome to grade each other informally, particularly for exercise solutions that were not presented due to lack of time.

Everyone needs to present a fair share of solutions.
I will determine what this means once the course has started, depending on the number of signups.
If you cannot attend the weekly meetings, you can instead submit your solutions to the selected exercises in written form.

If you pass the exercise component of the course, you will be eligible for the exam.
This will be a four-hour written hall exam with no aids allowed.
The exam problems will be similar to the exercises you have solved.
It may include problems of different levels for the purpose of grade differentiation.
More details will be announced in time before the exam.

### For PhD students

If take this course as a PhD course, you need to do some additional work to pass.
* You need to be active in our weekly discussions.
  This includes giving feedback to students who present exercise solutions.
  If a student cannot attend our meeting and submits written solutions instead, I will distribute them to the PhD students in the course to informally grade and formative feedback.
* You need to achieve a grade of 4 in the exam.

## Course schedule

I will schedule our weekly meeting according to the results of [this poll](https://choodle.portal.chalmers.se/YZVDfAyYLAyTXKVW), so please vote (answers are private).
It will take place on the Johanneberg campus.
I cannot make any guarantees about the ability to participate remotely.

The date for the final exam will be announced a month before the end of course.
I will schedule it according to the participants' schedule.

## Course literature

* Egbert Rijke's [*Introduction to Homotopy Type Theory*](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.11082).

  This is the book this course is based on.
  A printed version is due to appear, but the above version will remain freely available.

* [*Homotopy Type Theory: Univalent Foundations of Mathematics*](https://homotopytypetheory.org/book/) by the Univalent Foundations Program.

  This is a secondary resource.
  You may consult it to go deeper into some of the material or to find different perspectives.
  I may use it for some exercises.

Our stream is called *HoTT reading course*.

The stream is organized into *topics* (Zulip lingo for threads).
Feel free to create new topics, for example for questions that you want to discuss.
This is useful if you are stuck on something in your weekly reading.
Conversely, you can help your fellow students by engaging with and possibly answering their questions.

One benefit of Zulip over Slack and Discord is that it is free software.
It also supports [LaTeX rendering](https://zulip.com/help/latex)!
